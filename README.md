## What Is This?

This is an example repo corresponding to multiple lessons within the LearnHowToProgram.com walkthrough on creating a Shape Tracker application in the [C# and .NET Pre-Work: Basic Console Applications](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/basic-console-apps/). The functionality in the C# Shape Tracker app is meant to match [the JavaScript Shape Tracker app](https://github.com/epicodus-lessons/section-5-shape-tracker/tree/3_multiple_business_logic_files) that Epicodus students created in the Intermediate JavaScript course.

There are multiple branches in this repo that are described more below.

## How To Run This Project

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "ShapeTracker". 
3. Run `dotnet run` in the command line to run the console app. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal. Take note that the user interface will vary from branch to branch.
4. Optionally, you can run `dotnet build` to compile this console app without running it.
